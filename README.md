When game starts a map with random objects: pits and a finis, is generated.

The character can move when the keyboard buttons are pressed.

If he traps into a pit object - he dies, if he reaches the finish - he wins.

The program has a home screen, a screen for victory and defeat screen.

P.S. This game is first game writen down by myself. 

Game was made in 5 days without knowing anything about sfml, without idea of how the game 
should look like and i barely could imagine how exactly game making by yourself looks and feels. 

This was a good bunch of experience and i appreciate it.
